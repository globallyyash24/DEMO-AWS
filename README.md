+
+-Go to the EC2 instance. At the bottom of the screen, you will see the section called "Connect". Click on the connect button. In the connection dialog, you will see different options for connecting to your instance such as EC2 Instance Connect, Session Manager and SSH. Select the "SSH Client" tab. Here you will find the SSH command that you can copy and paste into your CLI and then press enter to connect to your EC2 instance.
